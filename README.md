## A Few words about myself

I grow up in the middle of Vietnam, my academic career makes me love who I am, and my life has been amazing. By doing research, I can contribute a little of my works to our society. As a kid, I’m already passionate about engineering design and building projects for solving certain issues of our daily life.


### My Academic Journey

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Nhiem/trannhiem.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
